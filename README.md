About
-----------

In the years of research required to create the more than a thousand evidence-based videos on [NutritionFacts.org][nutritionfacts.org], Michael Greger, MD, FACLM, has arrived at a list of what he considers the most important food types to include in a healthy daily diet. Yes, greens are good for you, but how much should we actually consume each day?

Dr. Gregerâ€™s Daily Dozen details the healthiest food variations and how many servings of each we should try to check off for every day. He explains his rationale in the book of his, [How Not to Die][book]. All the fundamentals earnt from his books, DVDs, and speaking engagements is all donated to charity.
