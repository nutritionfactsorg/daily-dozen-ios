Consider the Other Vegetables category: a cup of bell peppers has a much lower caloric density than a cup of cooked sweet potatoes, therefore the caloric range will depend on your specific food choices. That’s the great thing about the Daily Dozen Checklist—it’s not a one size fits all approach, and can be adapted to your needs.";

If you are new to eating a lot of beans (or grains, greens, etc!), you may need to start with smaller amounts and slowly increase the quantity in order to give your microbiome a chance to adjust. You can also get creative: for example, add some beans to your morning oatmeal. If you load it up with berries, flax seeds, and nuts, you won’t even notice the beans. You can also mash beans into a sandwich spread, or make my [BROL](https://nutritionfacts.org/recipe/basic-brol-barley-rye-oats-and-lentils)—barley, rye, oat groats, and lentils—that I use as a base for many meals and is a simple way to get a variety of whole grains with a built-in serving of legumes.";
